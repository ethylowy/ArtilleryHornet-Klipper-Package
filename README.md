# Pre-compiled images
Those files are intended to be uploaded via STM32CubeProgrammer, so You'll need to trip Your printer into DFU mode.
I've personally made myself a momentary button in the back of the printer, so i can switch into flash mode without dissassembling the bottom of the printer every time.
After flashing the Klipper file, just upload all the files included in configuration folder.

I'll update this instruction with time, so please, be patient ;)

# DISCLAIMER
I used the stuff uploaded by https://github.com/EmmeFreeze/ and https://github.com/labotecno so most of the credits are theirs.
I just wanted to put all the goodies in one place, as one-packet-installation for those, who want to swap Hornet's Marlin to Klipper as smooth as posible.
