# HOW TO FLASH KLIPPER ON HORNET
I'll update this instruction with time, so please, be patient ;)

# DISCLAIMER
I used the stuff uploaded by https://github.com/EmmeFreeze/ and https://github.com/labotecno so most of the credits are theirs.
I just wanted to put all the goodies in one place, as one-packet-installation for those, who want to swap Hornet's Marlin to Klipper as smooth as posible.
